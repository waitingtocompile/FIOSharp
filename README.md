# FIOSharp
A nice C# binding for the FNAR Information Oracle REST API. Using RestSharp and Json.Net targetting .NET Core, although it should also work properly on .NET framework with little to no changes.

Currently only has objects and methods for a small portion of the API (read: the portion I need).
